# Gent Architecture

Minimal agent harness. Effect-first. Small seams. One owner per concern.

## Rules

- Schema-first transport contract.
- Thin transport adapters.
- Command/query services, not god facades.
- Runtime owns orchestration.
- Platform edges stay explicit.
- TUI routes own screen state; components render and dispatch.
- Extension hooks are structural descriptors, not stringly maps.

```

Process topology is secondary. Default CLI topology is not.

Default `gent` resolves a shared server via `Gent.server({ cwd, state: Gent.state.sqlite() })` — one server per DB, multiple clients. Topology derives from configuration: `Gent.state.memory()` for in-process owned, `Gent.state.sqlite()` for registry-aware shared, `Gent.client({ url })` for remote.

## Transport Boundary

Source of truth:

- `packages/core/src/server/transport-contract.ts`

That module owns:

- client-facing types
- queue/session/message projections
- contract semantics

Adapters:

- `packages/sdk/src/client.ts`
- `packages/core/src/server/rpcs.ts`
- `packages/core/src/server/http-api.ts`

Rule:

- no client-specific DTO remodeling
- no parallel contract surfaces
- handlers and adapters derive from the same contract types

## App Services

The app surface is split by concern:

- `SessionCommands`
- `SessionQueries`
- `SessionEvents`
- `InteractionCommands`

`packages/core/src/server/index.ts` is intentionally small. It only assembles `AppServicesLive`.

`packages/core/src/server/dependencies.ts` owns startup wiring:

- runtime platform
- storage/event store
- auth/config/model registry
- provider stack
- extension loading (delegated to `RuntimeProfileResolver`)
- actor/runtime services

It is the composition boundary. Not the domain boundary.

### RuntimeProfileResolver

`packages/core/src/runtime/profile.ts` is the single discover → setup → reconcile → sections pipeline. Two paths used to do this independently (and drift, e.g. dropping bus subscriptions on the per-cwd path); now both go through the resolver paired with `buildExtensionLayers`:

- **Server startup** (`server/dependencies.ts`) — resolves once at boot, builds the registry/state/event-bus layer via `buildExtensionLayers`, publishes the profile as a tag so `agentRuntimeLive` reuses the same prompt sections instead of recomputing.
- **Per-cwd profile cache** (`runtime/session-profile.ts`) — resolves lazily per unique cwd, builds the same layer shape via `buildExtensionLayers` inside the captured server scope.

Ephemeral child runs (`runtime/agent/agent-runner.ts`) intentionally do NOT call the resolver — they forward an already-resolved `ExtensionRegistry` from the parent and only rebuild the per-run mutable bits (storage, event bus, state runtime) for isolation. That divergence is structural, not duplication.

`compileBaseSections(profile)` resolves dynamic prompt sections inside the extension-services runtime so contributions like `Skills`'s prompt section can read services from their own `setup.layer`.

## Runtime

Core orchestration lives in:

- `packages/core/src/runtime/actor-process.ts`
- `packages/core/src/runtime/agent/agent-loop.ts`
- `packages/core/src/runtime/agent/agent-loop.state.ts`
- `packages/core/src/runtime/agent/agent-loop.utils.ts`

Shape:

- `ActorProcess` is the single command entry for session/branch actor work.
- `AgentLoop` is a flat machine-owned control plane (turn phases inlined, state uses union-level derive).
- `AgentRunner` is the helper-agent boundary. Durable runs create persisted child sessions; ephemeral runs use isolated in-memory storage and only publish parent-side `AgentRun*` receipts.
- local CLI routing is in-process by default; remote routing is explicit server topology
- queue ownership is structural
- turn phases are explicit (resolve → stream → execute-tools → finalize)
- interactions are cold machine states, not blocked fibers
- machine inspection events are published as diagnostics
- `AgentRunnerConfig` is a plain interface passed to `InProcessRunner`/`SubprocessRunner`, not a service

Do not rebuild business logic from inspection events. They are receipts, not inputs.

### Agent Runs

- Default persistence is durable.
- Read-only helper agents (`explore`, `librarian`, `reviewer`, `auditor`, `summarizer`, `title`) default to ephemeral.
- Durable runs persist a child session/branch and can be revisited with `read_session`.
- Ephemeral runs still execute a full local `AgentLoop`, but against isolated in-memory storage; they return text/usage/tool-call metadata without polluting the session tree.
- Callers that need durable history must opt in explicitly, e.g. task execution forces `persistence: "durable"`.

### Interactions (Cold Pattern)

One interaction primitive: `ctx.approve({ text, metadata? })` → `{ approved, notes? }`.

Tools that need human input call `ctx.approve()`, which delegates to `ApprovalService`. The pattern is cold — no blocked fibers, survives restarts.

```text
tool calls ctx.approve({ text, metadata? })
  → ApprovalService.present() checks for stored resolution (cold resume)
    → if found: returns { approved, notes? }
    → if not: persists to InteractionStorage, publishes InteractionPresented
      → InteractionPendingError thrown
        → machine parks in WaitingForInteraction (cold, no task fiber)

client responds via respondInteraction RPC
  → storeResolution(requestId, { approved, notes? })
    → machine receives InteractionResponded
      → WaitingForInteraction → ExecutingTools
        → tool re-runs, calls ctx.approve(), finds stored resolution
          → continues normally
```

**Projection-driven UI.** The `@gent/interaction-tools` extension contributes a `ProjectionContribution` that derives the pending-interaction snapshot from `InteractionPendingReader.listPending(scope)` per evaluation. Its UI snapshot reflects the pending interaction state (`{ requestId, text, metadata }` or `{}`). The client reads this from `extensionSnapshots` — no dedicated `activeInteraction` field on the transport contract. Source of truth is the storage row, not an in-memory mirror (`derive-do-not-create-states`).

Key properties:

- **No Deferred, no blocked fiber.** `WaitingForInteraction` is a cold state — no `.task()`, no background work. The machine is checkpointed and survives restarts.
- **Crash-safe resume.** `rehydrate()` rebuilds the in-memory context lookup and re-publishes the event. If the process dies before wake, `listPending()` in `InteractionStorage` provides the pending requests for recovery.
- **Tool re-execution on resume.** The full `executeToolsPhase` re-runs. Pre-interaction side effects re-execute (idempotent by convention). No continuation payloads.
- **Permissions are not interactive.** Default-allow with explicit deny rules. `Permission.check` is a synchronous policy check, never blocks.

Files: `interaction-request.ts` (InteractionPendingError, makeInteractionService), `approval-service.ts` (ApprovalService), `interaction-tools/projection.ts` (InteractionProjection — UI from storage), `interaction-pending-reader.ts` (read-only seam for extensions), `agent-loop.state.ts` (WaitingForInteraction), `interaction-commands.ts` (respond orchestration).

## Platform Boundaries

Core runtime should not reach for ambient process state unless the app shell is the real owner.

Explicit platform/runtime seams:

- `RuntimePlatform`
- tracer/logger services
- file system / path / OS services

### FileIndex

`FileIndex` — indexed file discovery backed by native Rust file finder (`@ff-labs/fff-bun`).

Production stack: `NativeFileIndexLive` (FFF, per-cwd cached finders, `.gitignore`-aware) → fallback `FallbackFileIndexLive` (Bun.Glob walk + stat). Native failure (missing binary, unsupported platform) silently degrades to fallback. Layer always succeeds.

GlobTool and GrepTool use `FileIndex.listFiles()` for file discovery, then filter with `Bun.Glob.match()` for pattern correctness. This replaces per-invocation directory walks with indexed lookups.

Files:

| File                                                       | Purpose                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/core/src/domain/file-index.ts`                   | Service tag, `IndexedFile`, `FileIndexError`      |
| `packages/core/src/runtime/file-index/native-adapter.ts`   | FFF-backed adapter (dynamic import, polling scan) |
| `packages/core/src/runtime/file-index/fallback-adapter.ts` | Bun.Glob walk fallback                            |
| `packages/core/src/runtime/file-index/index.ts`            | `FileIndexLive` (native-first, catch-to-fallback) |

App entrypoints bind concrete Bun/OS behavior:

- `apps/tui/src/main.tsx`
- `apps/server/src/main.ts`

Production rule:

- `apps/tui/src/main.tsx` resolves a server via `Gent.server()` + `Gent.client()`
- `--connect <url>` attaches to a remote server via `Gent.client({ url })`
- `apps/server/src/main.ts` is the standalone durable server boundary

## TUI

TUI is a client over the shared contract, not a parallel app.

Production shape:

- local mode: one process owns renderer, runtime, storage, and reconnect UX under one root scope
- remote mode: TUI shell attaches to an external server boundary and rehydrates from transport state
- reconnect logic rehydrates from runtime state, not UI guesses

Main boundaries:

- `apps/tui/src/client/context.tsx` for client/session/event state
- `apps/tui/src/routes/session-controller.ts` for session-screen orchestration
- route state machines for modal/session surfaces
- components like `composer.tsx`, `message-list.tsx`, `queue-widget.tsx` as presentation + local interaction

Rules:

- one screen-level owner for session state
- one keyboard owner per route surface
- overlays/composer flows modeled explicitly
- renderer tests cover critical capture/focus paths

## Extensions

Extension shape lives in:

- `packages/core/src/extensions/api.ts` — public authoring surface (`defineExtension` + smart-constructor re-exports)
- `packages/core/src/domain/contribution.ts` — `Contribution` union (foundational data structure)
- `packages/core/src/domain/extension.ts` — server contract (`GentExtension`, `ExtensionSetup`)
- `packages/core/src/domain/extension-client.ts` — TUI contract (`ExtensionClientModule`, `ExtensionClientContext`)
- `packages/core/src/runtime/extensions/interceptor-registry.ts` — interceptor compilation (`compileInterceptors`)
- `packages/core/src/runtime/extensions/registry.ts` — server registry
- `packages/extensions/src/` — all 27 builtin extension implementations
- `apps/tui/src/extensions/` — TUI discovery, loading, resolution

### Dependency direction

```text
apps/tui, apps/server, packages/sdk
    ↓               ↓            ↓
@gent/extensions → @gent/core
                    (no reverse dep)
```

Core never imports from extensions. Composition roots (apps, SDK) pass `BuiltinExtensions` into `DependenciesConfig.extensions`.

### Extension boundary contract

Extensions (builtin and third-party) may import from:

- `@gent/core/extensions/api` — the authoring surface
- `effect-machine` — directly, for actor extensions
- `effect`, `@effect/*` — as peer deps

Extensions may NOT import from `@gent/core/domain/*`, `@gent/core/runtime/*`, `@gent/core/storage/*`, `@gent/core/server/*`, `@gent/core/providers/*`. The `no-extension-internal-imports` oxlint rule enforces this.

Rules:

- hooks are typed descriptors
- registration shape is structural — builtins, user, and project extensions share the same pipeline
- dispatch compiles once, then runs from typed hook maps
- extension hook boundaries are where plugin typing must stay strict
- actor snapshot schema is enforced at runtime — invalid public snapshots are dropped, not passed through
- activation/startup failures degrade the extension instead of crashing host startup
- `onInit` receives `sessionCwd` from the framework — extensions should not reach into `Storage`
- actor transition side effects cross explicit slots, not ambient service lookup inside machine handlers

For the full authoring guide, see [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md). Example extensions in [examples/extensions/](examples/extensions/).

### Server Extensions

One authoring shape: `defineExtension({ id, contributions: ({ ctx }) => [...] })`. Contributions are a flat `Contribution[]` array built with smart constructors (`toolContribution`, `agentContribution`, `interceptorContribution`, `projectionContribution`, `layerContribution`, `permissionRuleContribution`, `commandContribution`, `jobContribution`, `busSubscriptionContribution`, `onStartupContribution`/`onShutdownContribution`, `workflowContribution`, `actorContribution`, `queryContribution`, `mutationContribution`, `modelDriverContribution`, `externalDriverContribution`, `promptSectionContribution`).

Internally `defineExtension` lowers the contribution array into `ExtensionSetup` for the runtime registry. The `Contribution` union (`packages/core/src/domain/contribution.ts`) is the foundational data structure — adding a new kind triggers a compile error in `placeContribution` until handled.

- Stateless: tools, interceptors, jobs, bus subscriptions
- Stateful: `actorContribution` (legacy) or `workflowContribution` (preferred — `effect-machine` machine + declared effects) + optional `layerContribution`
- `Projection` (`projectionContribution(...)`) — read-only Effect that derives a value from services and surfaces it via `prompt`/`ui`/`policy` projectors. Replaces the actor-as-mirror pattern; lint rule `gent/no-projection-writes` enforces query purity. See `packages/core/src/domain/projection.ts` and `runtime/extensions/projection-registry.ts`.
- `Interceptor` (`interceptorContribution(defineInterceptor(key, handler))`) — typed pipeline transformations at known keys (`prompt.system`, `tool.execute`, `permission.check`, `context.messages`, `tool.result`, `turn.before`, `turn.after`, `message.input`, `message.output`). Composition: builtin (innermost) → user → project (outermost). See `packages/core/src/domain/interceptor.ts` and `runtime/extensions/interceptor-registry.ts`.
- `Query` / `Mutation` (`queryContribution(...)` / `mutationContribution(...)`) — typed RPC handlers invoked via `ctx.extension.query(ref, input)` / `ctx.extension.mutate(ref, input)` from tools or other extensions.
- `ModelDriver` / `ExternalDriver` — LLM providers and out-of-process turn executors (e.g. ACP). See `packages/core/src/domain/driver.ts`.
- Lifecycle effects (`onStartupContribution`/`onShutdownContribution`) compose in registration order; failures isolate the extension instead of crashing host startup.
- Agent override is turn-scoped via `QueuedTurnItem.agentOverride`, not persistent `SwitchAgent`.
- `createSession` accepts optional `initialPrompt` + `agentOverride` for atomic create-and-send.

### Extension Event Bus

`ExtensionEventBus` — channel-based pub/sub for extension communication (`runtime/extensions/event-bus.ts`).

- Agent events auto-published as `"agent:<EventTag>"` with sessionId/branchId after reduction
- `busSubscriptionContribution("agent:*", handler)` — wildcard subscription
- `busSubscriptionContribution("extensionId:channel", handler)` — targeted side-effect handlers
- Handlers MUST return `Effect<void>` — Effect-native end-to-end, no Promise edges
- Bus is observation / side-effect plumbing, not actor ownership or RPC-by-stealth

### Task Service Ownership

`TaskService.Live` is owned by the `@gent/task-tools` extension, not core:

- Provided via `ext.layer(TaskService.Live)` — task runs resolve `SubagentRunnerService` lazily when needed
- `task.list` RPC removed — TUI reads from `TaskProjection` (`packages/extensions/src/task-tools/projection.ts`), which queries `TaskStorage` on demand. The actor no longer mirrors task events; UI snapshot derivation lives in the projection.
- task mutation flows through the extension boundary, not direct core wiring (the actor is currently a pure RPC dispatcher; Commit 4 will replace it with typed Mutation contributions)
- `task.output` RPC stays as thin lazy query (message summaries too heavy for snapshots)
- Core `dependencies.ts` no longer imports or wires `TaskService` — it comes through the extension layer graph
- Event-publisher evaluates registered projections after every event and emits `ExtensionUiSnapshot` for each ui-bearing projection — the snapshot pipeline is unified across actor and projection sources

### TUI Extensions

- Builtins are individual `.client.ts` files in `apps/tui/src/extensions/builtins/`
- Each follows `ExtensionClientModule` contract — same pipeline as user/project extensions
- Loader accepts `disabled` list to filter extensions by id before `setup()` is called
- `ExtensionClientContext` provides `sessionId`, `branchId`, `openOverlay`, `closeOverlay`
- `useExtensionUI()` exposes reactive `sessionId()`, `branchId()`, `snapshots()` for widgets
- Widgets are zero-prop components that self-source from context hooks

### Extension State Runtime Lifecycle

Extension actors (state machines) are managed by `ExtensionStateRuntime`. Key patterns:

**Lazy init with Deferred readiness** (`state-runtime.ts`):

- `getOrSpawnActors(sessionId)` registers a Deferred placeholder under `spawnSemaphore`, then spawns + inits actors OUTSIDE the lock. Concurrent callers await the Deferred.
- This prevents deadlocks where extension actor spawn triggers events that re-enter `getOrSpawnActors`.

**Queued delivery after append** (`dependencies.ts`, `state-runtime.ts`):

- `EventStore.publish` appends and fanouts storage subscribers only
- extension delivery is a separate queued runtime concern owned by `ExtensionStateRuntime`
- per-session workers serialize actor delivery and queue nested publishes instead of skipping them
- ordinary command paths still await delivery where causal consistency matters

**effect-machine integration**:

- `Machine.spawn` is cold — no I/O, no inspector, no supervisor before `actor.start`. Recovery (state loading) and supervisor arming happen during `start`.
- Extension actors use `spawn-machine-ref.ts` to bind one actor-shaped definition onto the runtime boundary.
- Machine transitions stay explicit: pure state changes in handlers, side effects through declared slots.
- `AgentLoop` uses effect-machine's `Lifecycle` API: `recovery.resolve` loads checkpoints + runs `makeRecoveryDecision`, `durability.save` persists checkpoints after transitions.

## Testing

Use the smallest honest boundary:

- pure helpers: unit tests
- transport/app services: Effect tests
- TUI render/capture: OpenTUI renderer tests
- runtime ordering/turn semantics: recording layers + runtime tests

### Commands

| Command            | Scope                                          | Target   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `bun run test`     | core + tui + sdk + fast in-process integration | ~2-4s    |
| `bun run test:e2e` | PTY e2e + supervisor + worker-http transport   | ~60-120s |
| `bun run gate`     | typecheck + lint + fmt + build + test          | ~15s     |

### Test structure

`packages/core/tests/` mirrors `packages/core/src/`:

```text
tests/
├── domain/        # auth-store, auth-guard, agent, event, message, skills, ...
├── extensions/    # api, registry, compile-tool-policy, hooks, loader, memory/, ...
├── providers/     # provider, provider-auth, provider-resolution, anthropic-keychain
├── runtime/       # agent-loop, actor-process, retry, agent-runner, tool-runner, ...
├── server/        # rpcs, session-queries, system-prompt
├── storage/       # sqlite-storage, search-storage, task-storage, bypass
├── debug/         # sequence-provider
└── test-utils/    # sequence
```

One test file per source file. No god tests. Names match source owners.

`packages/e2e/tests/` separates fast in-process contracts from slow end-to-end:

- `test` — direct-transport contract tests (in-process, no subprocess)
- `test:e2e` — PTY TUI tests, supervisor lifecycle, worker-http transport

### Important files

- `packages/core/src/test-utils/index.ts` — `SequenceRecorder`, recording layers
- `packages/core/src/test-utils/in-process-layer.ts` — `baseLocalLayer`
- `packages/core/src/test-utils/e2e-layer.ts` — `createE2ELayer`
- `packages/core/src/debug/provider.ts` — `DebugProvider`, `createSignalProvider`, `createSequenceProvider`
- `apps/tui/tests/render-harness.tsx` — TUI render test harness
- `packages/e2e/tests/transport-harness.ts` — shared worker + transport cases

## Interaction Tools Extension

`@gent/interaction-tools` — `ask_user` and `prompt` tools, plus an `InteractionProjection`.

The projection derives the pending-interaction snapshot from `InteractionPendingReader.listPending(scope)` per evaluation (storage row is the source of truth — no actor mirror). Its UI snapshot shape is `{ requestId?, text?, metadata? }`. The client reads the snapshot from `extensionSnapshots` and renders the appropriate interaction UI (routed by `metadata.type`). Both event-driven hydration (via `EventPublisherLive` re-evaluating projections) and cold-start hydration (via `SessionQueries.getSessionSnapshot` calling `projections.evaluateUi`) include this snapshot.

## Artifacts Extension

`@gent/artifacts` — generic artifact store with typed protocol. Any tool/extension can persist artifacts via `ctx.extension.ask(ArtifactProtocol.Save(...))`.

Actor state: `{ items: Artifact[] }`. Upsert by `sourceTool + branchId` (last-writer-wins). Artifacts are branch-aware — prompt projection filters to current branch. Agent-facing tools: `artifact_save`, `artifact_read`, `artifact_update`, `artifact_clear`.

Plan, audit, and review tools save artifacts deterministically after producing results. The `@gent/plan` extension is tool-only (no actor) — planning results are persisted as artifacts.

## Auto Loop Extension

`@gent/auto` — iterative workflow driver via effect-machine.

State: `Inactive | Working | AwaitingReview`. Signal tool: `auto_checkpoint`. Gate: `review` tool completion between iterations (proves adversarial review actually ran). Safety: `maxIterations` ceiling + `turnsSinceCheckpoint` wedge detection.

### JSONL Persistence

`AutoJournal` writes append-only `.gent/auto/<goal-slug>.jsonl` relative to cwd. `active.json` pointer tracks which journal to resume. Row types: `config`, `checkpoint`, `review`.

Cross-session replay via `onInit`: child sessions verify ancestry includes `active.sessionId`. Fail-closed for legacy pointers without `sessionId`. Root sessions never replay.

### Handoff Ownership

`@gent/auto` and `@gent/handoff` are cleanly separated:

- Auto detects context fill → queues follow-up telling model to call `handoff` tool
- Handoff extension owns presentation, cooldown, and user interaction
- Handoff extension skips when auto is active (guard on auto actor snapshot)

### Task Service

`TaskService` is owned by the `@gent/task-tools` extension (not core). It correlates child sessions via synthetic `toolCallId` (`task:<taskId>`). The `SubagentSpawned` event filter matches on `toolCallId`, preventing concurrent tasks from stealing each other's child session.

`task.output` RPC returns `MessageSummary[]` (role + 200-char excerpt) alongside `messageCount`.

### Test Utilities

- `withTinyContextWindow(effect)` — patches `MODEL_CONTEXT_WINDOWS` to 5k tokens for threshold tests
- `trackingApprovalService()` — returns `{ layer, presentCalled: Ref<boolean> }` for approval assertions

Both exported from `@gent/core/test-utils/e2e-layer`.

## Memory Extension

Builtin extension (`@gent/memory`). Persistent memory across sessions via flat `.md` files.

### Vault

```text
~/.gent/memory/
├── index.md                          # Root index
├── global/
│   ├── index.md
│   └── <topic>.md
└── project/
    └── <project-name>-<sha256_6>/
        ├── index.md
        └── <topic>.md
```

Session-local memories are volatile (actor state only). Promotion to disk is explicit via tools.

Project key: `<basename>-<sha256_6>` of canonical repo root — collision-safe across same-named repos.

### Tools

- `memory_remember` — write to vault (project/global) or session state
- `memory_recall` — search/list memories, full content for search, index for no-query
- `memory_forget` — remove from vault or session state

### Prompt Injection

Compact summary injected as system prompt section. Capped at 8 entries (session + project + global). `memory_recall` tool available for deep dives beyond the cap.

### Dreaming

Extension-defined system agents run in headless mode for memory consolidation:

- `memory:reflect` — review recent sessions, extract project-level memories (weekday evenings)
- `memory:meditate` — consolidate vault, merge duplicates, promote patterns to global (weekly)

Architecture:

```text
memory extension
  → declarative scheduled job contributions
  → host-owned scheduler reconciliation
  → real gent executable in headless mode
  → gent headless session with system agent
  → agent uses memory_remember/recall/forget tools
```

Scheduling is host-owned, not an extension startup side effect. Memory contributes durable global jobs; the host reconciles installation/removal and degrades scheduler failures without crashing extension activation.

Key files:

| File                                                | Purpose                       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |

| `packages/extensions/src/memory/index.ts`           | Extension registration        |

## Observability

Wide event boundaries (one structured log per unit of work) via `effect-wide-event`:

| Boundary        | Service       | File                                            |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Agent turn      | `agent-loop`  | `runtime/agent/agent-loop.ts` (TurnMetrics ref) |
| Tool call       | `tool-runner` | `runtime/agent/tool-runner.ts`                  |
| Provider stream | `provider`    | `runtime/agent/agent-loop.ts`                   |
| RPC request     | `rpc`         | `server/rpc-handlers.ts`                        |
| Agent run       | `agent-run`   | `runtime/agent/agent-runner.ts`                 |

Logging conventions:

- Structured annotations: `Effect.logInfo("noun.verb").pipe(Effect.annotateLogs({ key: value }))`
- Never `Effect.logWarning("msg", error)` — always `.pipe(Effect.annotateLogs({ error: String(e) }))`
- Tool-level errors captured via `WideEvent.set({ toolError: "..." })` (value-level, not effect failures)

Log destinations:

- `/tmp/gent.log` — server-side JSON (via `GentLogger`)
- `/tmp/gent-client.log` — TUI-side JSON (via `clientLog`)
- `/tmp/gent-trace.log` — span traces (via `GentTracerLive`)

Request-ID correlation: TUI generates `crypto.randomUUID()` at `sendMessage`/`createSession`, passes via `requestId` field in transport contract. Server threads into log annotations and RPC wide event boundaries.

## Non-Goals

- No cluster/distribution roadmap in this document.
- No compatibility notes for deleted facades.
- No process-purity dogma. Same-process direct transport is fine.

This doc describes the architecture we want to keep, not the migration history we already paid for.
