# Core extension reduction: execution receipt

Goal started 2026-09-08. Status: in progress.

Plan: [core-extension-reduction-2026-09-08.md](core-extension-reduction-2026-09-08.md).
Source baseline: `a3c424d550ad1da91b35bdcb84c8c85bf7bb8e2d`.
Workspace: `/Users/cvr/Developer/personal/.rifts/gent/core-extension-reduction`.
Branch: `refactor/core-extension-reduction`.

## Baseline

Physical TypeScript/TSX lines include comments and blank lines. Core includes its source test utilities and debug helpers. Markdown is excluded. Count each real source tree once; core-internal points to core/src.

| Source tree             | Files |  Lines |
| ----------------------- | ----: | -----: |
| packages/core/src       |   201 | 45,419 |
| packages/extensions/src |    56 |  9,402 |
| packages/sdk/src        |     7 |  1,050 |
| apps/tui/src            |   143 | 22,839 |
| apps/server/src         |     2 |    794 |

The core package has two export keys for one authoring surface: `./extensions/api` and `./extensions/api.js`. The separate private package has two wildcard keys. No public runtime, protocol, or testing entry point exists yet.

## Commit sequence

1. Remove core-internal imports from core's own implementation tests.
2. Move TUI-only helpers out of core. Define and adopt client schemas and the small host/testing contracts. Delete the private package after the last consumer moves.
3. Replace the fixed cell selection with a typed extension tool-surface seam.
4. Add branch resources under the existing actor scope. Make the kernel use ordinary extension declarations and lifetime rules.
5. Move product defaults and context policy. Audit and remove redundant internal paths and files.

The remaining units may need more than one logical commit. Each code commit must pass the full gate and a live Herdr check before the next unit. Review and record the actual paths changed. Record deleted lines separately from moved lines.

## Core implementation test imports

Changed 833 module specifiers in 133 files under packages/core/tests. Each now resolves directly to the owning core source file. The mechanical comparison matched the original source with only path replacement. A duplicate ids import in model-context.test.ts appeared after paths converged; it was merged. Test bodies and fixtures were retained. Production source counts and export counts are unchanged.

Validation: core typecheck passed. The full gate passed after the duplicate-import fix. A direct TUI build selected the Rift binary. Live Herdr ran Luna, evaluated `6 * 7` in a cell, displayed 42 in preview, and reached idle with CORE-IMPORTS-GREEN.

Evidence:

- `/tmp/gent-core-test-imports-files.txt` lists every changed test file by full path.
- `/tmp/gent-core-test-imports-gate.log`
- `/tmp/gent-core-reduction-build.log`
- `/tmp/gent-core-test-imports-herdr.txt`
