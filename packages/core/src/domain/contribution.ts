/**
 * Contribution buckets — typed sub-arrays for `defineExtension`.
 *
 * C8: the legacy `Contribution` discriminated union is gone. Extensions now
 * declare their leaf values in homogeneously-typed buckets. The bucket name
 * IS the discrimination — no `_kind` field on leaves, no wrapper smart
 * constructors, no `filterByKind`.
 *
 * Capabilities (B11.5): authored exclusively through the typed factories
 * `tool({...})` / `request({...})` / `action({...})` at
 * `domain/capability/{tool,request,action}.ts`. The legacy lowering smart
 * constructors `tool` / `request` aliases from the old split were deleted in B11.5d.
 *
 * Resource keeps an identity smart constructor (`resource`) below — it
 * exists to widen variance at the bucket boundary, not to lower a legacy
 * shape.
 *
 * Codex BLOCK on C8 design: drivers split into `modelDrivers` and
 * `externalDrivers` — one untagged `drivers: []` would smuggle back the
 * ambiguity C7's correlated union fixed.
